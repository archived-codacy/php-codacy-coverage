# Codacy PHP Coverage Reporter
[Codacy](https://codacy.com/) coverage support for PHP. Get coverage reporting and code analysis for PHP from Codacy.

# Prerequisites

- PHP 5.3 or later
- One of the following coverage report formats
  - Clover XML (e.g. ```--coverage-clover``` in PHPUnit)
  - [Only for PHPUnit <4] PHPUnit XML (e.g. ```--coverage-xml``` in PHPUnit)

# Installation

Setup codacy-coverage with Composer, just add the following to your composer.json:

```js
// composer.json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "codacy/coverage": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Download the dependencies by running Composer in the directory of your `composer.json`:

```sh
# install
$ php composer.phar install --dev
# update
$ php composer.phar update codacy/coverage --dev
```

codacy-coverage library is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/codacy/coverage).

Add the autoloader to your php script:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

> Note:
We have php5-curl dependency, if you have issues related to curl_init() please install it with:
```
sudo apt-get install php5-curl
```

## Alternative Installation (using phar)

Setup codacy-coverage as phar, you can simply download a pre-compiled and ready-to-use version as a phar to any directory. Simply download the latest `codacy-coverage.phar` file from our [releases page](https://github.com/codacy/php-codacy-coverage/releases):

[Latest release](https://github.com/codacy/php-codacy-coverage/releases/latest)

That's it already.

## Updating Codacy

To update Codacy, you will need your project API token. You can find the token in Project -> Settings -> Integrations -> Project API.

Then set it in your terminal, replacing %Project_Token% with your own token:

```
export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=%Project_Token%
```

> Note: You should keep your API token well **protected**, as it grants owner permissions to your projects.

> To send coverage in the enterprise version you should:
```
export CODACY_API_BASE_URL=<Codacy_instance_URL>:16006
```

# Usage

Run ```vendor/bin/codacycoverage``` to see a list of commands.

#### Basic usage for Clover format:

```vendor/bin/codacycoverage clover```

#### Basic usage for PHPUnit XML format:

```php vendor/bin/codacycoverage phpunit```

By default we assume that
- your Clover coverage report is saved in ```build/logs/clover.xml```
- your PHPUnit XML report is saved in the directory ```build/coverage-xml```

#### Optional parameters:

You can specify the path to your report with the second parameter:

- Clover XML
  - ```php vendor/bin/codacycoverage clover path/to/a-clover.xml```
- PHPUnit XML
  - ```php vendor/bin/codacycoverage phpunit directory/path/to/phpunitreport```

Even more control:

- ```--base-url=<OTHER_URL>``` defaults to http://codacy.com
- ```--git-commit=<COMMIT_HASH>``` defaults to the last commit hash

## Circle CI

This project sends its own coverage during the build in circleCI.
Feel free to check our `circle.yml`, and send your coverage as a step of your build process. 

## Travis CI

Add codacycoverage to your `.travis.yml`:

```yml
# .travis.yml
language: php

# Do not forget to provide your CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN as described in https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings

php:
  - 5.3
  - 5.4
  - 5.5
  - 5.6
  - hhvm

# In case of timeouts and build failures you may want to prepend 'travis_retry' to the following commands:
before_script:
  - curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
  - php composer.phar install -n

script:
  - php vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover build/coverage/xml

after_script:
  - php vendor/bin/codacycoverage clover build/coverage/xml
```

## Troubleshooting

If you have a fatal error regarding curl_init():
```
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function Codacy\Coverage\Util\curl_init() in /src/Codacy/Coverage/Util/CodacyApiClient.php:30
```
Run: ```sudo apt-get install php5-curl```
